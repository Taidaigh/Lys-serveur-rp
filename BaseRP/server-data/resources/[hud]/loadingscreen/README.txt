First of all, thank you for downloading Genesis Load



Installation

1 Go to the config.js and modify what do you want.
2 Go to the index.html and modify what do you want.
3 Modify the loadsong.oog and the logo.png
4 Add all of the files in the __resource.lua
5 Install it in your FiveM server and enjoy !

Notes

- If you use a basic background install with the loading screen, remove all the others, so that you do not have too heavy files.
- Prefer a music not too long, load on a FiveM server is easier fast...

If you have any issue, do not hesitate to contact me
